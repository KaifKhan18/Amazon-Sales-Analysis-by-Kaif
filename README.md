Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from Amazon to derive insights and trends that can help in understanding customer behavior and improving business strategies. Using Python, various data manipulation and visualization libraries have been employed to perform a comprehensive analysis of sales metrics.

Objectives-
Data Cleaning and Preparation: The project begins with importing raw sales data, followed by data cleaning processes to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various statistical methods and visualizations are used to explore the data, uncovering patterns such as seasonal trends, popular products, and customer purchasing behaviors.
Sales Trend Analysis: Detailed analysis of sales trends over time, including monthly and seasonal variations, helps identify peak sales periods.
Customer Segmentation: Implementing clustering techniques to categorize customers based on purchasing habits, enabling targeted marketing strategies.
Visualizations: Creating informative and interactive visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to present findings in an easily digestible format.

Technologies Used-
Python: The primary programming language for data analysis and manipulation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For documenting the analysis process and sharing insights.

Conclusion:
This project provides valuable insights into Amazon sales data, enabling better decision-making and strategic planning. The methodologies and visualizations developed can serve as a foundation for future analyses and applications in e-commerce data science.
